## Plant Growth Tracking

### Growth Stages
- **Seedling**: Initial germination and early leaf development
- **Growing**: Active vegetative growth and establishment
- **Flowering**: Bloom development and pollination phase
- **Fruiting**: Fruit/seed development and maturation
- **Harvest**: Ready for collection and consumption

### Health Monitoring
Plants are rated on a 1-10 health scale considering:
- **Leaf Color & Condition**: Vibrant, disease-free foliage
- **Growth Rate**: Meeting expected development milestones
- **Pest Resistance**: Natural immunity and resilience
- **Root Development**: Strong foundation and nutrient uptake

## Knowledge Sharing System

### Tip Categories
- **Watering**: Irrigation techniques, schedules, and water conservation
- **Soil**: Composition, amendments, and soil health management
- **Pests**: Organic control methods and integrated pest management
- **Harvesting**: Timing, techniques, and post-harvest handling

### Verification Process
Community tips undergo peer review:
1. **Submission**: Gardener submits tip with experience level and details
2. **Community Review**: Other gardeners vote on helpfulness
3. **Expert Verification**: Experienced gardeners (reputation 200+) can verify
4. **Reward Distribution**: Verified tips earn additional reputation and tokens

## Seed Exchange Platform

### Trading Types
- **Free Sharing**: Community generosity and genetic diversity preservation

- **Token Trading**: GGT-based marketplace for rare varieties

### Quality Metrics
- **Harvest Year**: Seed age and viability tracking
- **Germination Rate**: Expected sprouting percentage
- **Organic Certification**: Chemical-free growing verification
- **Location**: Climate adaptation and shipping considerations

## Community Gardens

### Plot Management
- **Plot Allocation**: Fair distribution based on participation and need
- **Fee Structure**: Token-based rental system with sliding scale
- **Resource Sharing**: Tools, knowledge, and collaborative projects
- **Garden Rules**: Community-established guidelines and best practices

### Benefits
